[![Build Status](https://github.com/aiven/opensearch-connector-for-apache-kafka/actions/workflows/master_push_workflow.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/aiven/opensearch-connector-for-apache-kafka/actions)

This repository includes Aiven's OpenSearch [Apache Kafka® Connector](http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#connect) for Apache
Kafka®.

The project originates from
Aiven's [elasticsearch-connector-for-apache-kafka](https://github.com/aiven/elasticsearch-connector-for-apache-kafka).
The code was forked and all classes were renamed.

# Documentation

## Install and configure required software:
1. Install and Run Kafka (https://kafka.apache.org/quickstart)
2. Install and Run Kafka Connect (https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#connect_running)
3. Install and Run OpenSearch (https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/install-and-configure/install-opensearch/index/)
    - If OpenSearch is running on SSL, make sure to copy the credentials and copy them to woker properties as mentioned in Quickstart guide below
4. Install Aiven's OpenSearch® Sink Connector (see below)

## How to install Aiven's OpenSearch® Sink Connector

1. Connector plugins are packaged in zip/tar format to be released
2. Users download plugins from GitHub releases or build binaries from source
3. Users place connector plugins on Connect worker instances and add them via configuration
4. Start creating connectors using installed plugins

### Download binaries

Binaries are included on every release as zip/tar files: https://github.com/aiven/opensearch-connector-for-apache-kafka/releases/latest

### Build from Source

Execute gradle task to build binaries:

```shell
./gradlew installDist
# or ./gradlew assembleDist to package binaries
```

This produces an output on `build/install` directory with the plugin binaries to add into Connect cluster.

### Add plugin to Connect worker

Place unpacked binaries into a directory on each Connect worker node, e.g. `/kafka-connect-plugins`.

In this case, place `opensearch-connector-for-kafka` into `/kafka-connect-plugins`:

```
/kafka-connect-plugins
└── opensearch-connector-for-apache-kafka
```

Then, on each connect worker configuration make sure to add `/kafka-connect-plugins` to the `plugin.path` configuration:

```properties
plugin.path=/kafka-connect-plugins
```

### Validate Connector plugin installation

Once placed on each worker node, start the workers and check the plugins installed
and check the plugin (with the correct version) is included:

```shell
# Go to connector rest api
curl http://localhost:8083/connector-plugins | jq .
```
```json
[
  ...
  {
    "class": "io.aiven.kafka.connect.opensearch.OpensearchSinkConnector",
    "type": "sink",
    "version": "3.3.0"
  },
  ...
]
```

## Connector Configuration

[OpenSearch® Sink Connector Configuration Options](docs/opensearch-sink-connector-config-options.rst)

## QuickStart guide

1. Ensure that the required software is installed and running
2. Add OpenSearch Sink connector to Kafka Connect: Follow the 'How to install' instructions to add the OpenSearch sink connector to Kafka Connect. Example worker config is located here https://github.com/Aiven-Open/opensearch-connector-for-apache-kafka/blob/main/config/quickstart-opensearch.properties
3. Verify plugin installation : Visit http://localhost:8083/connectors to confirm that the OpenSearch sink connector is listed
4. Check ACLs (If Enabled): If ACLs are enabled on Kafka, ensure there are no authorization exceptions for the topic and group resources. Example of adding acls : https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#security_authz_examples
5. Produce Events: Produce JSON-formatted events to the Kafka topic specified in the worker properties.
6. Index Creation: An index will be created in OpenSearch with the same name as the Kafka topic.
7. Create Index Pattern: Create an index pattern in OpenSearch.
8. Discover Events: Events produced to the Kafka topic can now be discovered in OpenSearch.
9. Trouble shooting: If there are any deserialization errors in the connector logs, try setting schema.ignore to true.
